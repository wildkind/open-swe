    """Post all current findings to the PR as a GitHub Review.

    Call this once at the end of a review run, after you have finished adding
    findings (and, on a re-review, after marking resolved findings via
    ``update_finding``). The tool posts one GitHub PR Review for eligible
    inline findings, records the GitHub comment/thread IDs for future
    re-reviews, resolves GitHub threads for findings now marked resolved, and
    advances the reviewer thread's ``last_reviewed_sha``.

    On a re-review with no new findings to surface, it skips posting a new
    GitHub Review but still resolves fixed threads and updates reviewer state.

    Args:
        severity_threshold: Lowest severity to surface as inline GitHub comments
            (default ``medium``). Lower-severity findings stay in state and are
            mentioned in the review summary with a link to the web app, but are
            not posted as inline PR comments.
        cap: Maximum number of inline comments to publish (default 4).

    Returns:
        Dictionary with ``success``, ``review_id``, ``surfaced_count``,
        ``hidden_count``, ``resolved_thread_count``, and sometimes
        ``unresolvable_findings``, plus the flags below.

        ``success: true`` alone does NOT mean a GitHub Review was posted —
        check the flags:

        - ``skipped_empty_re_review: true`` (with ``review_id: null``): an
          empty re-review was deliberately skipped. No GitHub Review was
          created; the call was a valid no-op. Do not describe the review as
          published/posted/submitted.
        - ``dry_run: true`` (with ``review_id: null``): eval/benchmark mode —
          the publish was simulated and nothing was posted to GitHub. Do not
          claim publication.

        Only a numeric ``review_id`` (with neither flag set) confirms a real
        GitHub Review was created.

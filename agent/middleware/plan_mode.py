"""Plan-mode tool gating.

Hides tools that mutate external systems whenever plan mode is active — either
when the run starts in plan mode (the per-thread ``plan_mode`` carried in
configurable, e.g. a reject re-dispatch) OR after the model calls
``enter_plan_mode`` mid-run, which sets ``plan_mode`` in the run state. Installed
unconditionally so self-activation actually restricts the *next* model turn (the
tool list is recomputed on every model call), rather than only affecting a future
run.
